/*
Below is a solution to the SELF-TEST DIAGNOSTIC puzzle which is optimal in all benchmarks. It takes the data being 
passed and moves it through the nodes to the output (easy, but, it being the first puzzle, is meant as a tutorial).

Cycle: 83
Node: 8
Instruction: 8
Achievement: [BUSY_LOOP](https://github.com/KripkesBeard/TIS-100-stuff/blob/master/SELF-TEST%20DIAGNOSTIC/BUSY_LOOP)
