/*
This is a solution to SELF-TEST DIAGNOSTIC which satisfies the achievemtn BUSY_LOOP, the requirement of which is
for the program to take over 100,000 cycles.

As an overview, the program puts a value of 999 (the maximum) in each accumulator for each node, then goes on a cycle of
subtracting 1 until the value is -1, once this happens it sends a signal to the next node which then subtracts 1, sends a
signal back to the first node, and has the first node start over. Once the second node reaches -1, it sends a signal to the
third node, which subtracts 1, and sends a signal back to node 2, which sends a signal back to node 1 and then restarts. 
This cycle continues for all nodes until finally once the last node has reached -1, it sends a signal all the way back which 
lets the input go through all the nodes to the outup. So the run time is obviously exponential in the number of nodes, 
there are 5 nodes, so cycle count is roughly 1000^5. However, I believe that the first node and the second node
can each fit one more cycle in them, via the swap command between the accumulator and the back up register. So, hopefully
some day soon the cycle count will be somewhere around 1000^7 instead of 1000^5. THe issue is, of course, that there is a
limited amount of space for instructions (15 lines) in each node.

Cycle count: ~1000^5
Node count: 8
Instruction count: 65
Achievement: BUSY_LOOP
