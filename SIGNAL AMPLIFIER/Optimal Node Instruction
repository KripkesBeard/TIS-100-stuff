/*
This program solves the SIGNAL AMPLIFIER puzzle with optimal node and instruction counts. The puzzle gives you numerical
input and asks you to double it and return the value. This is accomplished with a minimal number of nodes and instructions
by moving the input to the accumulator register in the first node (the node where this happens doesn't matter), adding the
value of acc to itself, and then passing that value down to the output node.
