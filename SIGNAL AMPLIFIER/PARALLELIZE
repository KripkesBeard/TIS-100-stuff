/*
This program solves the SIGNAL AMPLIFIER puzzle while satisfiying both the PARALLELIZE achievement as well as being optimal
on cycle count. The puzzle gives numerical input and asks the user to double the input and output it in the same order as it
was input. The PARALLELIZE achievement is satisfied by having the cycle count be under 100, which can only be done through
parallel computing, as the name suggests. The program splits the input to different nodes which handle the computation 
concurrently and then feed the input back to the last node in the same order so that the conditions for passing the puzzle
are satisfied. This solution is opitmal for cycles but not for node or instructions.

Cycles: 84
Node: 5
Instructions: 12
